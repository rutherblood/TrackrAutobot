Email-Extracting-Assistant for myaiesec.net

To change the input parameters change the parameters value in the tuple 'tempDataPairs'. Just change the second value in each pair- the first is the name of the field- DO NOT CHANGE IT.

Hint: You get the parameter values from viewing the HTML source of myaiesec.net S&D page after you have the subcategories loaded. Will build in a GUI to enter parameters directly in future versions. ;)

EDIT: V4 saves work state in a file 'StateFile.txt'. Before fresh use, make sure you clear it out.

Also you will need the following to run this thing:
1- Python 3.3 or higher: Get the latest build of Python here- http://www.python.org/getit/
2-A nice portable code editor to get the tuple 'tempDataPairs' set for different parameters: I suggest Notepad++, get it here- http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.5.3.html

Also, please don't forget to remove the .txt file, 'emailIDDataTrackrAutobot.txt' from the local directory before any use.

Thats all!
